============================
Command Line Interface (CLI)
============================

**Mid-level approach that uses the S&C Library to expose commands that perform operations on the EV Chain.**

Overview
========

The **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is the perfect tool for advanced users to interact and operate in the **EV Charging Network** straight from the terminal. **CP Owners** can deploy and manage their Charging Point assets, while **EV Users** access the network to browse, discover and use such assets.

This is a mid-level approach to provide an interface for advanced users that want flexibility when accessing and operating with the platform. The CLI must aim to become the swiss army knife for developers, systems administrators or any breed of command line dwellers. Furthermore, it will enable automation through scripts or other advanced tools for deployment, testing, or Quality Assurance.
