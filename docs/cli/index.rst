Command Line Interface (CLI)
============================

**TODO short description**

The **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is the perfect tool for advanced users to interact and operate in our **EV Charging Network** straight from your terminal. **CP Owners** can deploy and manage their Charging Point assets, while **EV Users** access the network to browse, discover and use such assets.

Each implementation of a CLI will make use of its correspondent implementation of **EV Network Client Library**. For instance, the *Node.js* based CLI will use the *Node.js* EV Library. Different flavour are delivered, in order to best suit different needs for different environments or application stacks.
