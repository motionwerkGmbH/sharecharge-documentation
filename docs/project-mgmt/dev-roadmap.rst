===================
Development Roadmap
===================

Description of all the long-term roadmap phases.

* Our roadmap strongly depends on other projects' roadmaps such as ethereum, ewf, raiden, ipfs, etc.
* Each phase/step/milestone is named after a Rock&Roll song. Currently from ACDC songs.

Observations on some phase items:

* *Release* dates mark the end of the phase.
* *Development team* defines the profiles that are needed to cover and fulfill the objectives of the phase.

2018
====

In this year, the Share&Charge project is eventually coming out from stealth mode to the open source jungle. We expect to be working with testnets, pilot environments, proof-of-concepts, and usually consolidating the technology and solutions, together with our co-founders, partners and collaborators.

Hard as a Rock
--------------

* **Release:** June 2018
* **Description:** rock solid charging process, where everything related to the journey of charging an EV with a charging station is covered.
* **Milestones:**

  * Cover all scenarios for charging.
  * Begin with the simplest form of participants interacion (e.g. agree, start and wait until charging finishes, no stop) and move progressively towards more flexible/versatile cases (e.g. being able to interrupt/pause and resume a charging process).
  * Wallet management, transfer of tokens between EV drivers and CPs.
  * Develop tools and mechanisms to achieve a reliable solution and be able to identify problems, fix corner case errors, etc (e.g. test-driven development, comply with test coverage expectations).
  * By end of February we open source our core client, reference library, etc
* **Development team:** 2 blockchain developers, 1 full-stack developer, 1 backend developer, 1 devops.

Who Made Who
------------

* **Release:** August 2018
* **Description:** find and apply diferent mechanisms that allow us leverage privacy at transaction and data storage levels, to match the requirements that both regulation policies and partners/customers have.
* **Milestones:**

  * Ability to perform anonymous transactions by using zk-SNARKs.
  * Implement a distributed storage system (e.g. IPFS) to record data not suitable to place on-chain.
  * Identify, together with partners, users and network participants in general, the sensitive information versus the kind of information that can be shared.
  * In general, find a balance between a highly collaborative open system and the business privacy needs.
  * Possibly around this dates we should submit our smart contracts to be audited by an external consultancy company (e.g. OpenZeppelin).
* **Development team:** 3 blockchain developers, 2 full-stack developers, 1 backend developer, 1 devops, 1 security architect, 1 tech project manager

High Voltage
------------

* **Release:** october 2018
* **Description:** smart charging methodologies, techniques to ease the incrementing demand and stress put on the existing grid.
* **Milestones:**

  * A deep understanding on the grid infrastructure, along with finding the parts that could serve as connection points to our EV charging network.
  * Start working with the first most important inputs, indicators on the times where grid is overloaded.
  * Adapt our business logic and components to be configured and adapt/react dinamically to achieve a balance.
  * Integration of first payment gateways, possibly even a basic form of billing/invoicing mechanism.
* **Development team:** 4 blockchain developers, 2 full-stack developers, 2 backend developers, 1 devops, 1 security architect, 1 tech project manager, 1 data scientist

2019
====

Moment of truth, our ICO will be closing and Share&Charge platform is now ready to go live.

Jailbreak
---------

* **Release:** beginning of 2019
* **Description:** after a year strongly testing and evolving our platform and ecosystem of solutions in "testnet" environments, we take everything and put it on production-ready ecosystem ("mainnets").
* **Milestones:**

  * Public part of the ico.
  * All parts of the platform, ecosystem components have been tested thoroughly.
  * Switching from testnets to mainnets should be as painless as possible.
  * Ports, implementations of our reference libraries for different languages, frameworks or operating systems even.
* **Development team:** 5 blockchain developers, 2 full-stack developers, 2 backend developers, 1 devops, 1 security architect, 1 tech project manager, 1 data scientist, 1 QA engineer, 1 tech trainer

Highway to Hell
---------------

* **Release:** Q2 2019
* **Description:** adopt technologies such as Raiden to reach fast, cheap and scalable transactions for scenarios with very specific requirements/demands.
* **Milestones:** TBD
* **Development team:** 6 blockchain developers, 3 full-stack developers, 3 backend developers, 2 devops, 1 security architect, 1 tech project manager, 1 data scientist, 1 QA engineer, 1 tech trainer

Let There Be Rock
-----------------

* **Release:** Q4 2019
* **Description:** develop and implement a true self-sovereign digital identity system for the mobility industry, to expand the business cases available.
* **Milestones:** TBD
* **Development team:** 6 blockchain developers, 4 full-stack developers, 3 backend developers, 2 devops, 2 security architects, 2 tech project managers, 1 data scientist, 2 QA engineers, 2 tech trainers
