EV Charging Network
===================

**Proof-of-Authority based Blockchain network for Share&Charge**

Overview
========

The **S&C EV Charging Network** is the main pivotal part of the Share&Charge solution. It orchestrates our core business so that all the members participating in every different areas (e.g. *Charging Point Operators*, *Mobility Service Providers*) are coordinated when transacting value through charging sessions.

The **smart contracts** that conform the EV Charging Network are a critical part of the S&C ecosystem, as they provide of all the business logic functionality for *EV Drivers* and *Charging Stations* to exchange energy for tokens. The result of every session is recorded into what the industry commonly call *CDR (Charging Detail Records)*.

While there is a very limited portion of data stored on-chain, most of the data from the charging infrastructure of Charging Stations is stored in the **Inter-Planetary FileSystem** distributed storage platform.

The transfer of value is done by using an economic design that must use a number of token/coin uses:

* **Stable coin** for exchanging value.
* **Infrastructure coin** to paying for blockchain transactions, as a means of gas.
* **EV coin** representing the assets and the value found in the Share&Charge network.

In a Nutshell
=============

* **Consortium PoA network** running validators, regular nodes.
* **Smart contracts** business logic for managing charging infrastructure, charging sessions, or CDRs.
* **Token system** designed to provide access, utility and/or security tokens/coins.
* **Distributed filesystem** (i.e. *IPFS*) for storage of data related to assets, historical transaction records, etc.
