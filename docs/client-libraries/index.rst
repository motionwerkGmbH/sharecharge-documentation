EV Network Client Libraries
===========================

**Libraries conveniently exposing the business logic behind the S&C EV Charging Network.**

Our EV Libraries allow a **programmatic access** to all the functionality implemented in the **EV Charging Network**, such as:

* **CP Owners** provisioning their **Charging Points** to be accessible by the rest of Share&Charge users (usually with convenience tools such as our **S&C Command Line Interface)**
* **EV Users** accessing the network to discover, evaluate and request new charging processes from the existing offer of **Charging Points**.

Initially, interacting with our smart contracts involves communicating to a node through RPC calls (using **Web3**). This can be sometimes cumbersome to learn and implement. Thus, to make coding against these **easier**, Share&Charge provides client libraries in **different languages** that reduce this friction and empower developers to focus on making robust products and services on top of our platform.
